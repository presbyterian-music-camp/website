Camp Kintail has excellent facilities to meet PMC’s needs. There is lots more information about Camp Kintail on the <a href="https://www.campkintail.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kintail website</a>.<br>The only difficult part of the decision to locate at Camp Kintail is the distance for many campers. For more details about the decision to move to Camp Kintail, see the <a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/site-change-2023.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Site Story</a>.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i133"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is there cell service/Wifi?</span></strong></span></h6><p>Yes.

There are fridges in Harmony House and The Nest if you don’t have a fridge in your room.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13b"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I have allergies/dietary restrictions; can these be met?</span></strong></h6><p>Yes.

These parking spots have household 110V electrical hookups available; you will need to bring your own extension cords. Potable water is available from an outdoor tap at the back of the Lodge.

There are a couple of places available for this. Please ask at the camp office before plugging in your vehicle.</p><p>You will need to bring your own charger, and an extension cord.</p><p>The charging is Level 1 (household current).

Please see the <a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/this-year-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Year</a> page for the current schedule.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13m"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Do I have to take a workshop in every period?</span></strong></h6><p>No. Some campers like to sign up for 5 workshops and have a busy day, other campers take just a few of their favourite workshops, and some campers come just to enjoy being in the natural setting and spending time with friends and family.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13n"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Can I take different workshops on different days?</span></strong></h6><p>It depends. Some workshops like crafts are designed as drop-ins or scheduled for just a couple of days. Many of the workshops, particularly those that involve learning music as a group, are designed to build experience each day. For everyone’s enjoyment of these workshops, it’s important to have the same group working consistently together all week. You can talk to your workshop leader if you have questions about this. Of course, if you sign up for a workshop and find that it isn’t the right fit after one or two days don’t force yourself to stay; this just means you’ll end up with a free period, which isn’t always the worst thing! See the <a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/this-year-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Year</a> page for details on the workshops.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13o"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Do I have to participate in all of the camp-wide activities?</span></strong></h6><p>We encourage all campers to participate in order to get the full PMC experience and integrate into our community, and there are opportunities for participation, observation, cheering section, or whatever else you want. However, attendance at camp-wide activities is not mandatory. If you chose not to attend a camp-wide scheduled activity, we do ask that you not create a disruption for those who are taking part.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13p"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is there a PMC program for kids?</span></strong></h6><p>There are lots of activities for our younger campers.<br>Each morning, a child-minding program is available for ages up to 5, with music, games, and other activities. For ages 6-12 there is children’s choir and children’s games. Parents have a chance to participate in other workshops in the morning (or just hang out).<br>In the afternoon, there are a number of beginner-level workshops, crafts, and swimming to keep everyone busy. Some afternoon children’s or beginner-level workshops may have an age requirement or request for an adult companion - please see the <a href="https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/this-year-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Year</a> page for details, or check with the workshop leaders at the start of camp.</p><p>If your child is not in a workshop, they are your responsibility.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13q"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is PMC for me?

If a camper has needs that require specialized assistance (such as a full-time caregiver) they will need to bring someone to camp with them to help, and that person will need to register and pay for PMC. Bursaries may be available to help cover the cost of a care-giver for a camper with special needs.

This was the start of Create and Relate.</p><p>During the planning for the first year of virtual camp, these people asked to have their time together placed in the schedule—someplace—anyplace. The result was so enjoyable that the group decided to meet online once a month—and it now meets each month, except in August and occasionally in December. The people still come and go as they please and the activities are still changing and increasing in diversity.</p><p>For 2023-2024, we meet on the third Wednesday evening of each month, 7:00-9:00, on <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MzkxNjY2NGQtOWJmMi00ODM1LTg5MjgtNDc2ZDVhNTZkYWQ2%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2278aac226-2f03-4b4d-9037-b46d56c55210%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221660e769-3ffc-4242-ae05-08e6e76d76fe%22%7d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teams</a>.
