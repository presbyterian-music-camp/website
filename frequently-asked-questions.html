Camp Kintail has excellent facilities to meet PMC’s needs. There is lots more information about Camp Kintail on the <a href="https://www.campkintail.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kintail website</a>.<br>The only difficult part of the decision to locate at Camp Kintail is the distance for many campers. (Although some of the PMC community from the Ottawa area think it’s worth the drive.)</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i133"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is there cell service/Wifi?</span></strong></span></h6><p>Yes. Cell service is good at Camp Kintail, although some areas (and some carriers) are better than others.<br>Camp Kintail has free Wifi available throughout the site. Once again, some areas are better than others.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i134"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Why is camp only 5 days in 2024?</span></strong></h6><p>Camp Kintail is open for 10 months of the year and hosts lots of events. PMC 2024 is scheduled for Sunday-Friday to accommodate a wedding celebration that is already booked for August 24. Starting in 2025, PMC will be 6 days, Sunday to Saturday.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i135"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Why is there a limit of 150 people?</span></strong></h6><p>150 people at PMC means a lot of households represented. This makes planning sleeping accommodations very challenging. It’s becoming clear that, with the current demographics, 150 is about the limit.<br>We have found that with a camp community of more than about 150 people it is difficult to get to know everyone.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i136"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">What are the Covid protocols for PMC 2024?</span></strong></h6><p>The Covid protocols will be updated for 2024 and will be included in the Camper Guide. Please follow the vaccination protocol that is recommended for you and plan on testing before arriving at camp. Further information will be in the Camper Guide (link to follow when the Camper Guide is ready).</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i137"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Can I drink the water?</span></strong></h6><p>Camp Kintail has a state of the art water treatment system that includes chlorination. The water is tested daily to ensure that it meets all Ontario water legislation. Water testing and monitoring is by the same company that is responsible for the Town of Goderich.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i138"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Are all of my meals and snacks included?</span></strong></h6><p>For the most part, yes! Your camper fees include all meals at camp. The only exception is afternoon tuck, when a variety of snacks and drinks are available for purchase. All proceeds from tuck go to the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alison Stewart-Patterson fund</a>.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i139"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is the food actually good?</span></strong></h6><p>YES! Camp Kintail’s chef has a great reputation, and meals generally include a few options, so even the pickiest eaters should be satisfied! In addition, Kintail has an on-site garden that supplies some of their produce, and the dining hall has coffee, tea, and juice available at all times. </p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13a"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Can I bring my own food/snacks?</span></strong></h6><p>Yes. Camp Kintail is nut-free, so we ask that guests not bring food containing nuts/nut products onto the site. Please bring an animal-proof container if you’re planning on keeping any food in your living area. There are fridges in Harmony House and The Nest if you don’t have a fridge in your room.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13b"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I have allergies/dietary restrictions; can these be met?</span></strong></h6><p>Yes. The kitchen staff are used to dealing with different allergies and dietary needs with their summer camps and other rental groups, so they should be able to keep you well fed through the week.<br>If you have dietary needs please note them on your registration form, or contact the <a href="mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Registrar</a> to discuss your needs further. If you have very severe food allergies or multiple dietary restrictions and wish to bring some of your own food, please do that. There may be a fridge in your room; if not, there are fridges available in The Nest kitchen, and in the Harmony House kitchen.<br>The PMC Board has a Camp Liaison who will assist with any issues or concerns that arise at camp. Note that Camp Kintail is a nut-free facility.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13c"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Where will I be sleeping at Camp Kintail?</span></strong></span></h6><p>There are several different styles of accommodation at Camp Kintail, all of which are clean,  well-maintained and wheelchair accessible.<br>We do our best to assign one family to a dwelling; however, due to limited space it may be necessary for some families to share. We try to assign shared spaces to families who either know each other well or have asked to share.<br>There are bunk beds in all styles of accommodation. The registration form will ask for details about your willingness to use a top bunk.</p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul><li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cabins</span>:</strong> These are dormitory-style cabins that would usually sleep about 10-12 campers on bunk beds during Kintail’s regular summer program. We will be using some smaller cabins as well. The larger cabins each have 2 private change rooms. All of the cabins have electricity, but no washrooms.</li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yurts</span>:</strong> The four yurts have the same features as the larger cabins (including electricity and change rooms), just in a different structure. There are no washrooms in the yurts.</li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MacDonald Lodge</span>:</strong> The back half of MacDonald Lodge has several rooms that sleep 3-5 guests. Some of the beds are single/single bunks, and some have a queen on the bottom and a single on top. There are shared washrooms and showers in the hallway of the sleeping area.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Nest</strong></span>: The Nest has private and group rooms that can sleep 3-10 guests in bunk beds (single/single and queen/single, as in MacDonald Lodge). Each of these guest rooms includes a private full washroom.</li></ul></li></ul><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13d"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Can I request a bottom bunk?</span></strong></h6><p>There are bunk beds in all styles of accommodation. The registration form will ask for details about your willingness to use a top bunk. This information will help the Registrar assign your accommodation.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13e"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Can I bring my own trailer?</span></strong></h6><p>Camp Kintail has informal parking spots for RVs and trailers outside MacDonald Lodge. These parking spots have household 110V electrical hookups available; you will need to bring your own extension cords. Potable water is available from an outdoor tap at the back of the Lodge. If you plan to bring your trailer, please note that there is no sewer, but a dump site is located about 20-30 minutes away from the camp.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13f"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Do I have to stay with my family?</span></strong></h6><p>If you’re under age 13 (and won’t turn 13 before the end of the calendar year), then yes, you will need to stay with the parent or guardian who is with you at camp. For campers aged 13 and up we have male and female cabins available for singles of various ages and stages.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13g"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Where are the washrooms and showers?</span></strong></h6><p>Washrooms are in several locations around camp – you are within a couple of minutes of the nearest washroom:</p><table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: solid;" border="1"><tbody><tr><td class="align-center" style="width: 33.2843%;"><strong>Location</strong></td><td class="align-center" style="width: 33.2843%;"><strong>Washroom</strong></td><td class="align-center" style="width: 33.2889%;"><strong>Shower</strong></td></tr><tr><td style="width: 33.2843%;">MacDonald Lodge</td><td style="width: 33.2843%;">Male<br>Female<br>Gender-neutral</td><td style="width: 33.2889%;">Male<br>Female<br>Gender-neutral</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 33.2843%;">The Nest</td><td style="width: 33.2843%;">Male<br>Female<br>Gender-neutral</td><td style="width: 33.2889%;">Male<br>Female<br>Gender-neutral</td></tr><tr><td style="width: 33.2843%;">Harmony House</td><td style="width: 33.2843%;">Gender-nuetral</td><td style="width: 33.2889%;"> </td></tr><tr><td style="width: 33.2843%;">Cabin Hill</td><td style="width: 33.2843%;">Male<br>Female</td><td style="width: 33.2889%;"> </td></tr></tbody></table><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MacDonald Lodge</span> has a few options for washrooms and showers:</p><ul><li>Campers staying in MacDonald Lodge have shared washrooms and showers off their corridor.</li><li>Campers staying elsewhere can use the male or female washrooms and showers off the Dining Hall.</li><li>Anyone can use the gender-neutral washroom and shower off the Dining Hall.</li></ul><p>And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Nest</span> has options for washrooms and showers:</p><ul><li>Campers staying in The Nest have a washroom with shower in the room.</li><li>Campers staying elsewhere can use the male or female washrooms and showers on the main floor.</li><li>There is a gender-neutral accessible washroom and shower on the main floor of The Nest.</li></ul><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13h"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is Camp Kintail accessible for people with disabilities?</span></strong></h6><p>Yes! Great care has been taken in recent years to ensure that all of Camp Kintail’s buildings, cabins, and activities are fully wheelchair accessible.<br>There are accessible washrooms and showers, and ramps everywhere.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13i"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Are there laundry facilities?</span></strong></span></h6><p>Yes.

Please see the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/this-year-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Year</a> page for the current schedule.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13m"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Do I have to take a workshop in every period?</span></strong></h6><p>No. Some campers like to sign up for 5 workshops and have a busy day, other campers take just a few of their favourite workshops, and some campers come just to enjoy being in the natural setting and spending time with friends and family.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13n"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Can I take different workshops on different days?</span></strong></h6><p>It depends. Some workshops like crafts are designed as drop-ins or scheduled for just a couple of days. Many of the workshops, particularly those that involve learning music as a group, are designed to build experience each day. For everyone’s enjoyment of these workshops, it’s important to have the same group working consistently together all week. You can talk to your workshop leader if you have questions about this. Of course, if you sign up for a workshop and find that it isn’t the right fit after one or two days don’t force yourself to stay; this just means you’ll end up with a free period, which isn’t always the worst thing! See the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/this-year-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Year</a> page for details on the workshops.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13o"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Do I have to participate in all of the camp-wide activities?</span></strong></h6><p>We encourage all campers to participate in order to get the full PMC experience and integrate into our community, and there are opportunities for participation, observation, cheering section, or whatever else you want. However, attendance at camp-wide activities is not mandatory. If you chose not to attend a camp-wide scheduled activity, we do ask that you not create a disruption for those who are taking part.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13p"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is there a PMC program for kids?</span></strong></h6><p>There are lots of activities for our younger campers.<br>Each morning, a child-minding program is available for ages up to 5, with music, games, and other activities. For ages 6-12 there is children’s choir and children’s games. Parents have a chance to participate in other workshops in the morning (or just hang out).<br>In the afternoon, there are a number of beginner-level workshops, crafts, and swimming to keep everyone busy. Some afternoon children’s or beginner-level workshops may have an age requirement or request for an adult companion - please see the This Year page for details, or check with the workshop leaders at the start of camp.</p><p>If your child is not in a workshop, they are your responsibility.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13q"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Is PMC for me? Do I belong? Will I have a good time?</span></strong></h6><p>We try our best to make sure everyone feels welcome and has fun at PMC. When we fall short, we do our best to fix it. The Camp Deans and members of the Board are always available to help anyone in the community. Please read the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/welcome-statement.html">Welcome Statement</a> for more PMC thoughts on inclusion and belonging.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13r"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">I'm not Presbyterian; is that okay?</span></strong></span></h6><p>Absolutely. PMC’s community is diverse in this way (and many others). See the <a href="https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/welcome-statement.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Welcome Statement</a> for more on this.</p><h6 id="mcetoc_1hcqmls6i13s"><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">Someone in my family has special needs; can they come to camp?</span></strong></span></h6><p>Yes! If a camper has needs that require specialized assistance (such as a full-time caregiver) they will need to bring someone to camp with them to help, and that person will need to register and pay for PMC. Bursaries may be available to help cover the cost of a care-giver for a camper with special needs.

This was the beginning of what is now called Create and Relate.</p><p>During the planning for the first year of virtual camp, these people asked to have their time together placed in the schedule—someplace—anyplace. The result was so enjoyable that the group decided to meet online once a month—and it now meets each month, except in August and occasionally in December. The people still come and go as they please and the activities are still changing and increasing in diversity.</p><p>This year, we meet on the third Wednesday evening of each month on Teams. The reminder and link are put on our Facebook page, on Discord (yes, this group still uses Discord), and on the PMC calendar. Any PMCer can join. We’d love to see you.
