Given that I am 21 years old, you might deduce that I’ve been coming to this wonderful place for my whole life. My non-camp friends often ask, “why do you keep going back?” After all, “summer camp” tends to carry a childish connotation and, by definition, I am no longer a child.  There are many reasons why I keep coming back to camp each year. I’ll just touch on one of them here.</p><p>PMC is a fantastic place to grow as a musician, regardless of your age or playing ability. It is filled with the most supportive people I’ve ever met, and for that reason it’s a safe place to try new things without fear of failure and ridicule. My years at camp have been defined by a series of instances where I threw myself into something I knew nothing about and came out with a new passion. To my memory, the first of these instances was when I joined the concert band not one month after first picking up the flute. I could barely play a scale, but for some reason my 10-year-old self decided to join an ensemble comprising mostly of skilled musicians with several years’ (if not decades) experience on their instruments. However, before I could feel overwhelmed by the piece of music set before me, I was introduced to a much more talented flutist who I later learned was a music teacher by profession. She helped me get through my first week of concert band, and I left camp that year determined to come back the following year able to hold my own in the concert band.</p><p>A couple of years later, as a teen, I joined the jazz band, where I was confronted with an equally daunting challenge: improvisation. Luckily, as with concert band, I wasn’t without guidance. Karl and Brennan, the workshop leaders, were both seemingly virtuosic in their improvisation skills and also incredibly patient as I came to understand concepts like the blues scale and the twelve-bar blues. Jazz band became a staple of my PMC experience for several years after, which made me a much more confident and creative musician. Also, I don’t know anyone else outside of music camp who has the opportunity to swap solos with professional jazz musicians, which is rad.</p><p>Of course, there’s also an abundance of music that happens outside of daily workshops- music camp is an opportunity to try out any musical ideas that have come to you during the year. In recent years, some friends and I have formed a woodwind ensemble. It’s the only time in the year that I get to play classical and baroque chamber music, and I cherish it. Me and my older sister are even able to overcome our differences and sing together sometimes. Sometimes.</p><p>My musical experiences at camp have been both incredibly unique and commonplace. They’ve been unique in the sense that there is no other place in the world where I have found such a compassionate and talented group of people who are willing to share their ideas and passion with you. They’ve been commonplace in the sense that when at camp, I see other people, young and old, Christian and atheist, sharing similar formative experiences.</p></div></div></body></html>
