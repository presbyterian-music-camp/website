With both simplicity and brevity, he states that faith, hope, and love are, as he describes them, the choicest of graces. In this famous verse of Scripture, the words, often quoted at weddings, and printed, have hit a chord in the modern world. With this phrase, Paul wraps up this section explaining why godly, self-sacrificing love is required to fully express spiritual gifts. He concludes by mentioning love again with two other virtues often listed with it: faith and hope. Together, these three virtues "abide" or "remain." They are eternal.</p><p>Throughout this protracted time of COVID isolation we have all needed to lean on our faith, to find hope when others around us may have none, and to respond with love in a hardening world. As a community, when we are at camp (I mean on the ground, walking the dusty road camp) theses graces are in abundance. The camp experience we often find inexplicable, is a manifestation of, the synergy of the gathering of people in the name of Jesus Christ.</p><p>During this 2021 virtual camp experience we hope you are able to reflect on the words of Paul. This is an opportunity to share how faith, hope, and love have played a part in our lives, how they have helped us with the challenge of a pandemic, and how we can make these graces the tenets of our future. </p><h2>Schedule</h2><p>The schedule is available <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=47lmlug9dndktfcplq96rfndi0@group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Toronto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>!</p><p>Anything before about 11:00 will be pre-recorded.</p><h2>Deadlines</h2><table><tbody><tr><td>Date</td><td>What</td></tr><tr><td>Aug 6</td><td><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z10jqwk5k1Mla9g3MiKYYEtQpCaf1GYN3Uw2-32_5lw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up for Variety House</a></td></tr><tr><td>Aug 9</td><td>Videos for Ubi Caritas and Land Acknowledgements – see Discord for instructions</td></tr><tr><td>Aug 15</td><td>Videos for Variety House due – watch Discord for information on how to submit</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Discord</h2><p>We’ve mentioned Discord a few times now. If you haven’t used it since last year (or ever!) don’t despair, help is on the way.</p><p>If you used Discord last year, it should be there waiting for you this year.

In Discord, find Notification Settings on your device, and set it up so it works for you. You might also have to go to Settings on your device to allow notifications from Discord.</p><h2>Group Gatherings</h2><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">IF Covid rules allow for a gathering in your area, invite some PMC friends over and share the LOVE.</span></p><p><strong>Remember</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: outside is always better, respect the numbers, mask if you have/want to, follow the rules.</span></p><h2>Registration</h2><p>With a virtual camp, there is no Registration, and very little cost…BUT</p><ul><li>This is PMC’s second year with no income.</li><li>We have some ongoing expenses – like website hosting fees, Zoom account fees, CCLI license.</li><li>We anticipate that there will be increased interest in bursaries when we return to in-person camp.</li></ul><p>If you can (and only if you can) please consider making a small donation to the Alison Stewart Patterson fund for camp bursaries so we can go into next year in a healthy position. Our suggestion is $10 for an individual or $25 for a family, but you can donate more, or less, it’s up to you.</p><p>If you’ve already paid for registration, you can request a refund, or redirect your payment to the ASP bursary fund.</p><p>To make a donation: do an e-transfer to pmctreasurer@gmail.com with the security question: what is this payment for and the security answer: aspfund</p><p>For any other financial transactions, contact the treasurer at <a href="mailto:pmctreasurer@gmail.com">pmctreasurer@gmail.com</a></p><p>Thank you for your support of the PMC ministry!</p><h2>Mailing List</h2><p>We know there are lots of people in your life who would LOVE PMC.
