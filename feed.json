Camp Kintail has excellent facilities to meet PMC’s needs. There is lots more information about Camp Kintail on the <a href=\"https://www.campkintail.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kintail website</a>.<br>The only difficult part of the decision to locate at Camp Kintail is the distance for many campers.

Once again, some areas are better than others.</p>\n<h6 id=\"why_was_camp_only_5_days\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Why was camp only 5 days in 2023 &amp; 2024?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Camp Kintail is open for 10 months of the year and hosts lots of events. PMC 2023 &amp; 2024 were scheduled for Sunday-Friday to accommodate wedding celebrations that were already booked. Starting in 2025, PMC will be 6 days, Sunday to Saturday.</p>\n<h6 id=\"why_is_there_a_limit_on_campers\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Why is there a limit on the number of campers?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>There are a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>sleeping spaces, and lower bunks</li>\n<li>kitchen capacity</li>\n<li>large space capacity</li>\n<li>the ability to form a community</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We consider the size carefully, and do whatever we can to ensure that as many people as possible can enjoy PMC.</p>\n<h6 id=\"what_are_the_covid_protocols\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">What are the Covid protocols?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Covid has become a part of our lives now.

In addition, Kintail has an on-site garden that supplies some of their produce, and the dining hall has coffee, tea, and juice available at all times. </p>\n<h6 id=\"can_I_bring_my_own_snacks\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Can I bring my own food/snacks?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Yes.

There are fridges in Harmony House and The Nest if you don’t have a fridge in your room.</p>\n<h6 id=\"I_have_allergies_dietary_restrictions\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">I have allergies/dietary restrictions; can these be met?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Yes.

Some workshops like crafts are designed as drop-ins or scheduled for just a couple of days. Many of the workshops, particularly those that involve learning music as a group, are designed to build experience each day. For everyone’s enjoyment of these workshops, it’s important to have the same group working consistently together all week. You can talk to your workshop leader if you have questions about this. Of course, if you sign up for a workshop and find that it isn’t the right fit after one or two days don’t force yourself to stay; this just means you’ll end up with a free period, which isn’t always the worst thing! See the <a href=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/pmc-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This Year</a> page for details on the workshops.</p>\n<h6 id=\"do_I_have_to_participate_in_all_activities\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Do I have to participate in all of the camp-wide activities?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>We encourage all campers to participate in order to get the full PMC experience and integrate into our community, and there are opportunities for participation, observation, cheering section, or whatever else you want. However, attendance at camp-wide activities is not mandatory. If you chose not to attend a camp-wide scheduled activity, we do ask that you not create a disruption for those who are taking part.</p>\n<h6 id=\"is_there_a_program_for_kids\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Is there a PMC program for kids?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>There are lots of activities for our younger campers.<br>Each morning, a child-minding program is available for ages up to 5, with music, games, and other activities. For ages 6-12 there is children’s choir and children’s games. Parents have a chance to participate in other workshops in the morning (or just hang out).<br>In the afternoon, there are a number of beginner-level workshops, crafts, and swimming to keep everyone busy. Some afternoon children’s or beginner-level workshops may have an age requirement or request for an adult companion - please see the <a href=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/pmc-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This Year</a> page for details, or check with the workshop leaders at the start of camp.</p>\n<p>If your child is not in a workshop, they are your responsibility.</p>\n<h6 id=\"is_pmc_for_me\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Is PMC for me? Do I belong? Will I have a good time?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>We try our best to make sure everyone feels welcome and has fun at PMC. When we fall short, we do our best to fix it. The Camp Deans and members of the Board are always available to help anyone in the community. Please read the <a href=\"https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/welcome-statement.html\">Welcome Statement</a> for more PMC thoughts on inclusion and belonging.</p>\n<h6 id=\"Im_not_presbyterian\"><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">I'm not Presbyterian; is that okay?</span></strong></span></h6>\n<p>Absolutely. PMC’s community is diverse in this way (and many others). See the <a href=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/welcome-statement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Statement</a> for more on this.</p>\n<h6 id=\"special_needs\"><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Someone in my family has special needs; can they come to camp?</span></strong></span></h6>\n<p>Yes! If a camper has needs that require specialized assistance (such as a full-time caregiver) they will need to bring someone to camp with them to help, and that person will need to register and pay for PMC. Bursaries may be available to help cover the cost of a care-giver for a camper with special needs. Contact our <a href=\"mailto:pmcregistrar@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Registrar</a> for more information.</p>\n<h6 id=\"Is_2slgbtqi_friendly\"><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Is PMC 2SLGBTQIA+ friendly?</span></strong></span></h6>\n<p>Yes. Both PMC and Camp Kintail are fully inclusive. Love is love (and gender-neutral washrooms and showers are available).</p>\n<h6 id=\"do_I_need_strong_musical_skills\"><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">I don’t know if my musical skills are good enough; should I come to camp?</span></strong></span></h6>\n<p>While most of our workshops are music-focused we do have several options every day that are non-musical as well, so don’t let this stop you from coming! For our musical workshops we offer a variety of skill levels, so everyone from beginners to advanced musicians will have somewhere that they fit in. See the <a href=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/pmc-2025.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This Year</a> page for details of this year’s schedule, and the <a href=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/welcome-statement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Welcome Statement</a> for more details about musical ability (or the lack thereof).</p>\n<h6 id=\"how_will_I_get_to_know_people\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">I found PMC online and want to come, but I won’t know anyone! How will I get to know people?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Not to toot our own horns, but we are very welcoming! Everyone was a new camper at one time, whether they came with a parent or friend or just thought PMC sounded great and came by themselves. We do our best to help new campers feel at home in our community.</p>\n<h6 id=\"pmc_mailing_list\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">What is the PMC mailing list, and how do I get on it?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>PMC has a mailing list (through GoogleGroups). We send summaries of PMC Board meetings, and other information that might be of interest to the wider camp community. The PMC mailing list includes people who have never been to camp, or who haven't been for a while. If YOU want to be on the PMC Community Mailing List, send an <a href=\"emailto: PMC.M.Comms@gmail.com\">email</a> and we'll add you.</p>\n<h6 id=\"financial_assistance\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Is financial assistance available?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Yes. Information about our bursary funds, as well as guidance on how to apply, is available on the <a href=\"https://presbyterian-music-camp.github.io/website/register.html\">Register</a> page.</p>\n<h6 id=\"domations\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">How do I make a donation to PMC?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>There are a few ways to donate to PMC</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">NEW</span></strong> Use <a href=\"https://www.canadahelps.org/en/dn/99322\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Canada Helps</a> to make your donation.</li>\n<li>Donate when you register.</li>\n<li>Donate at camp through an offering at a service.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may choose to specify your donation goes to a specific <a href=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/charitable-funds.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">charitable fund</a> of PMC.</p>\n<p>If you need assistance with your donation, contact the <a href=\"mailto:pmctreasurer@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treasurer</a>. </p>\n<p>PMC is a registered charity. You will receive a tax receipt at the end of the year for your donation(s).</p>\n<h6 id=\"pmc_the_rest_of_the_year\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e03e2d;\">Does anything happen the other 51 weeks of the year?</span></strong></h6>\n<p>Yes!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.presbyterianmusiccamp.ca/media/posts/68/Create-and-Relate.001.jpeg\" alt=\"Create&amp;Relate\" width=\"385\" height=\"216\"></figure>\n<p>A few years ago, a group of PMC campers were sitting on the beach doing a variety of activities with their hands: mending clothes, sewing, crocheting, embroidering, sketching, painting, corking, and cross-stitching. This was the start of Create and Relate.</p>\n<p>During the planning for the first year of virtual camp, these people asked to have their time together placed in the schedule—someplace—anyplace. The result was so enjoyable that the group decided to meet online once a month—and it now meets each month, except in August and occasionally in December. The people still come and go as they please and the activities are still changing and increasing in diversity.</p>\n<p>For 2023-2024, we meet on the third Wednesday evening of each month, 7:00-9:00, on <a href=\"https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_MzkxNjY2NGQtOWJmMi00ODM1LTg5MjgtNDc2ZDVhNTZkYWQ2%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2278aac226-2f03-4b4d-9037-b46d56c55210%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%221660e769-3ffc-4242-ae05-08e6e76d76fe%22%7d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Teams</a>. The reminder and link are put on our Facebook page, on Discord (yes, this group still uses Discord), and on the PMC calendar, or you can just click on the Teams link above. Any PMCer can join. We’d love to see you. Contact <a href=\"mailto:m.j.perry@mac.com\">MJ Perry</a> if you want more information.</p>\n<p> </p>",
